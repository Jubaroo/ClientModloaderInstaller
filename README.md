# ClientModloaderInstaller
Installer for the client modloader. The goal is to make is as simple as possible to install the client modloader on PC.
Everything will be done for you through the install wizard. In a future version I plan to have the installer auto detect the correct folder for you to install. 
* Installer has been written from scratch using [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page).
